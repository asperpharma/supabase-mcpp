# Welcome to your Lovable project

## Project info

**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID

## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.

**Use Claude Code**

[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) is an agentic coding tool from Anthropic that lets you work with Claude directly from your terminal or IDE.

Install the extension:

```sh
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Then start a session in your project directory:

```sh
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
claude
```

Claude Code can read, edit, and create files, run terminal commands, and assist with complex multi-step coding tasks — all while keeping you in control.

## Production-Ready Checklist

### Quick Deploy

Simply open [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID) and click on Share -> Publish.

### Required Setup

⚠️ **Before workflows can run successfully, you must configure GitHub Secrets:**
- **LOVABLE_WEBHOOK_URL** (Required) - Enables file and issue sync with Lovable
- **DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL** (Optional) - Enables deployment notifications

📖 **See [docs/GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md](./docs/GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md) for step-by-step instructions**

### Automated Deployment Flow

This project uses an automated deployment pipeline:

1. **Push to Main**: When code is merged to the `main` branch, Lovable automatically deploys the changes
2. **Health Check**: GitHub Actions runs a post-deployment health check after 120 seconds
3. **Verification**: The workflow pings the `/health` endpoint to verify the deployment succeeded
4. **Notifications**: Optional Discord notifications for deployment status

### GitHub Actions Secrets Setup

The sync workflows require the following secret to be configured in GitHub repository settings
(**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**):

| Secret | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `LOVABLE_WEBHOOK_URL` | Optional | Webhook URL for syncing file changes and issue/PR events to Lovable. If not set, the sync steps are skipped gracefully. |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | Optional | Discord webhook for deployment status notifications. |

**How to get `LOVABLE_WEBHOOK_URL`:**
1. Open your Lovable project at https://lovable.dev/projects/657fb572-13a5-4a3e-bac9-184d39fdf7e6
2. Go to **Settings → Integrations** (or **Settings → GitHub**)
3. Copy the webhook URL shown there
4. Add it as a repository secret named `LOVABLE_WEBHOOK_URL`

> If the webhook URL is not visible in the Lovable UI, contact Lovable support with project ID `657fb572-13a5-4a3e-bac9-184d39fdf7e6`.

### Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- **Live Site**: https://asperbeautyshop-com.lovable.app/
- **GitHub Actions**: Check workflow runs for health check results
- **Lovable Dashboard**: https://lovable.dev/projects/657fb572-13a5-4a3e-bac9-184d39fdf7e6

- [ ] ✅ Security review completed
- [ ] ✅ Documentation updated

## Deployment

### Quick Deployment via Lovable

For simple deployments, open [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID) and click Share → Publish.

### Production Deployment Workflow

For production deployments with health checks and verification, follow this workflow:

```
Health Checks → Fix 503 Errors → Create PR → Deploy → DNS Setup → Verify
```

#### Step 1: Run Health Checks

Before deploying, verify all systems are operational:

```bash
# 1. Check frontend health endpoint
curl https://asperbeautyshop-com.lovable.app/health

# Expected: {"status":"ok","version":"1.0.0","checks":{"supabase":true,"shopify":true}}

# 2. Check bulk product upload health (Shopify integration)
curl https://YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/bulk-product-upload

# Expected: {"status":"ok","message":"Shopify secrets configured"}
# If you get 503, see "Fix 503 Errors" below

# 3. Run automated health check script
SITE_URL=https://asperbeautyshop-com.lovable.app node scripts/health-check.js
```

See [NEXT_STEPS.md](NEXT_STEPS.md) for detailed health check steps 1-5.

#### Step 2: Fix 503 Errors

If the bulk-product-upload health check returns **503 Service Unavailable**, you need to configure Shopify secrets:

```bash
# Set Shopify secrets in Supabase
supabase secrets set SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=your-store.myshopify.com
supabase secrets set SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=shpat_your_token_here

# Redeploy the function
supabase functions deploy bulk-product-upload

# Test again (should now return 200)
curl https://YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/bulk-product-upload
```

For detailed troubleshooting, see [PRE_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md §5](docs/PRE_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md#5-verify-secrets-configuration).

#### Step 3: Create Pull Request

Once health checks pass, create a PR for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create PR via GitHub CLI
gh pr create --base main --head feature/your-feature-name \
  --title "feat: Your Feature Title" \
  --body "Description of changes"
```

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-health-check.yml`) will automatically run health checks on merge to main.

#### Step 4: Deploy via Lovable

After merging to main:

1. Open [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID)
2. Click **Share** → **Publish**
3. Wait for deployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)
4. Verify deployment at https://asperbeautyshop-com.lovable.app

#### Step 5: DNS Setup (Optional)

To use a custom domain:

1. Navigate to **Project** → **Settings** → **Domains**
2. Click **Connect Domain**
3. Follow instructions to add DNS records
4. Wait for DNS propagation (~24-48 hours)

Read more: [Setting up a custom domain](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/custom-domain#custom-domain)

#### Step 6: Verify Production

Final verification checklist:

```bash
# Check all endpoints are responding
curl -I https://your-production-domain.com/
curl https://your-production-domain.com/health

# Run full health check suite
SITE_URL=https://your-production-domain.com node scripts/health-check.js

# Test bulk product upload with sample data
curl -X POST https://YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/bulk-product-upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "categorize",
    "products": [
      {
        "sku": "TEST-001",
        "name": "Moisturizing Face Cream",
        "costPrice": 15.00,
        "sellingPrice": 29.99
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Bulk Product Upload Example

Test the bulk product upload endpoint with this sample curl command:

```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/bulk-product-upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SUPABASE_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "categorize",
    "products": [
      {
        "sku": "ASPER-CREAM-001",
        "name": "Hydrating Face Cream with Hyaluronic Acid",
        "costPrice": 15.50,
        "sellingPrice": 34.99
      },
      {
        "sku": "ASPER-SERUM-002",
        "name": "Anti-Aging Vitamin C Serum",
        "costPrice": 22.00,
        "sellingPrice": 49.99
      }
    ]
  }'
```

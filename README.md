## Deployment

### Quick Deployment via Lovable

For simple deployments, open [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID) and click Share → Publish.

### Production Deployment Workflow

For production deployments with health checks and verification, follow this workflow:

```
Health Checks → Fix 503 Errors → Create PR → Deploy → DNS Setup → Verify
```

#### Step 1: Run Health Checks

Before deploying, verify all systems are operational:

```bash
# 1. Check frontend health endpoint
curl https://asperbeautyshop-com.lovable.app/health

# Expected: {"status":"ok","version":"1.0.0","checks":{"supabase":true,"shopify":true}}

# 2. Check bulk product upload health (Shopify integration)
curl https://YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/bulk-product-upload

# Expected: {"status":"ok","message":"Shopify secrets configured"}
# If you get 503, see "Fix 503 Errors" below

# 3. Run automated health check script
SITE_URL=https://asperbeautyshop-com.lovable.app node scripts/health-check.js
```

See [NEXT_STEPS.md](NEXT_STEPS.md) for detailed health check steps 1-5.

#### Step 2: Fix 503 Errors

If the bulk-product-upload health check returns **503 Service Unavailable**, you need to configure Shopify secrets:

```bash
# Set Shopify secrets in Supabase
supabase secrets set SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=your-store.myshopify.com
supabase secrets set SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=shpat_your_token_here

# Redeploy the function
supabase functions deploy bulk-product-upload

# Test again (should now return 200)
curl https://YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/bulk-product-upload
```

For detailed troubleshooting, see [PRE_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md §5](docs/PRE_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md#5-verify-secrets-configuration).

#### Step 3: Create Pull Request

Once health checks pass, create a PR for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create PR via GitHub CLI
gh pr create --base main --head feature/your-feature-name \
  --title "feat: Your Feature Title" \
  --body "Description of changes"
```

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-health-check.yml`) will automatically run health checks on merge to main.

#### Step 4: Deploy via Lovable

After merging to main:

1. Open [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID)
2. Click **Share** → **Publish**
3. Wait for deployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)
4. Verify deployment at https://asperbeautyshop-com.lovable.app

#### Step 5: DNS Setup (Optional)

To use a custom domain:

1. Navigate to **Project** → **Settings** → **Domains**
2. Click **Connect Domain**
3. Follow instructions to add DNS records
4. Wait for DNS propagation (~24-48 hours)

#### Step 6: Verify Production

Final verification checklist:

```bash
# Check all endpoints are responding
curl -I https://your-production-domain.com/
curl https://your-production-domain.com/health

# Run full health check suite
SITE_URL=https://your-production-domain.com node scripts/health-check.js

# Test bulk product upload with sample data
curl -X POST https://YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/bulk-product-upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "categorize",
    "products": [
      {
        "sku": "TEST-001",
        "name": "Moisturizing Face Cream",
        "costPrice": 15.00,
        "sellingPrice": 29.99
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Bulk Product Upload Example

Test the bulk product upload endpoint with this sample curl command:

```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/bulk-product-upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SUPABASE_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "categorize",
    "products": [
      {
        "sku": "ASPER-CREAM-001",
        "name": "Hydrating Face Cream with Hyaluronic Acid",
        "costPrice": 15.50,
        "sellingPrice": 34.99
      },
      {
        "sku": "ASPER-SERUM-002",
        "name": "Anti-Aging Vitamin C Serum",
        "costPrice": 22.00,
        "sellingPrice": 49.99
      }
    ]
  }'
```
